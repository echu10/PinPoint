PinPoint
=====================

A simple project I made while learning Angular.JS and Ionic. Uses Foursquare API and Google Maps JS API. 
This app was created for the indecisive people or couples or groups who can't figure out where they want to go. Instead of constantly saying "I don't care where we eat!" or "I don't care where we go as long as we choose something!", PinPoint picks a spot for you. It then displays a route where the venue is within walking distance.
